# TAIRP

**Description:** This repository contains two "tech a intern" data science - internship tasks focused on data analysis and machine learning.

## Task 1: Exploring and Visualizing a Dataset

- **Task Description:** In this task, we explored and visualized a Netflix user dataset using various data analysis tools and Python libraries. The objective was to gain insights into the dataset.
  
- **Key Activities:**
  - Data cleaning and preprocessing.
  - Descriptive statistics analysis.
  - Data visualization using various plots and charts.
  - Drawing conclusions and insights from the data.

## Task 2: House Price Regressor

- **Task Description:** Task 2, titled "House Price Regressor," involved developing a predictive linear regression model to estimate house prices based on input features.
  
- **Key Activities:**
  - Data collection of a dataset containing house-related features and house prices.
  - Data preprocessing including handling missing values, feature scaling, and encoding categorical variables.
  - Splitting the data into training and testing sets.
  - Model selection (Linear Regression).
  - Model training and evaluation using regression metrics (e.g., MSE, RMSE, RÂ²).
  - Making predictions on new data.
  - Fine-tuning the model for improved accuracy.
  - Interpretation and insights into the model's predictions and feature importance.
